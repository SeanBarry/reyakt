### STEP 1

1. Create Reyakt Library
2. Create Render function
3. Create Render destination and render an element
    render -> document.getElementById -> appendChild

### STEP 2

4. Create makeTag(tag, content) function
    createElement -> innerHTML
5. Insert makeTag into our render method


### STEP 3

6. Insert properties to makeTag(tag, properties, content)
7. If property does not exist, warn with an error


### STEP 4
8. Create shorthand functions for different elements
    p = (properties, children) => makeTag('p', properties, children)
9. Change 'content' to 'children' in React (because we want to start nesting elements)

### STEP 5
10. Allow other tags to be nested as opposed to just text

### STEP 6
11. Allow an array of tabs to be nested as opposed to a single tag
    Array.isArray(children)

### STEP 7
12. Create a proper 'Component' and start nesting them
13. Play around with changing text to other nested components (change link text to h1)

### Issues
Too many to count
Because I'm setting innerHTML, writing a tag will create that element.
Syntax still not as nice as JSX
Haven't done anything about event binding
Haven't done anything about virtual DOM
